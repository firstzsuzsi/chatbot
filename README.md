# NLP studies through making a chatbot
## Rationale
My goal is to acquire as much knowledge about Natural Language Processing and Data Science as possible as fast as possible.
I find the best route for that is learning by doing.
I will make multiple chatbots ranging from basic to more involved.
First I will only use the basic NLP tools available for Python.
Then create my own datasets, and train models myself.
Finally implement my chatbots in Hungarian, a heavily agglutinative language with a lot of exceptions to challenge myself.
