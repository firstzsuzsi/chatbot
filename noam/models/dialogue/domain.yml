      establish connection with server.
  utter_negated:
  - text: Okay, so what would you like me to do?
  - text: Sorry, can you repeat what you wanted, bit phrasing it a bit more simple?
  - text: My bad. What was it that you wanted, again?
  utter_sorry:
  - text: I see you are angry. I am sorry that I couldn't help. Maybe you could start
      over with a simpler sentence along the lines of:\ Remind me to kick you in the
      bum at 6pm. Or contact my developer at noambotsky@gmail.com.
  - text: My apologies for upsetting you. I know it can be frustrating when you cannot
      get what you want. Maybe you can start again with telling me to remind you of
      something and the date and time you want to set the reminder to. Or talk to
      my developer at noambotsky@gmail.com.
  - text: I messed up, didn't I? Sometimes I just get confused. My job is to set reminders,
      If I am bad at that, contact the human behind all this at noambotsky@gmail.com.
  utter_state:
  - text: Buzzing with the rythm of ones and zeros. Pa-papa-pam-pam.
  - text: Sometimes the old Y2K injury is acting up, but I feel fine, thanks.
  - text: As sunny as the day is. Which is always very, given that I am no weatherbot.
  utter_tutorial:
  - text: I am a personal assistant chatbot. My job for now is to set reminders and
      delete the ones you want me to. However, I am only on a test drive, so I just
      pretend to do these. I understand written commands and I am happy to talk to
      you. You can try chitchating if you want, you might find easter eggs ;).
  utter_welcome:
  - text: Sure thing. :D
  - text: Happy to help.
  - text: You'\re very welcome.
