  utter_sorry:
  - text: I am sorry that I couldn't help. Maybe you could start over with a simpler

      my developer at noambotsky@gmail.com.

      want. Maybe you can try again with a simpler request or talk to my developer
      at noambotsky@gmail.com.
  - text: Okay, I see this is not working. Sometimes I just get confused. This is
      what I can do set reminders and delete reminders. If I am bad at that, contact
      the human behind all this at noambotsky@gmail.com.
