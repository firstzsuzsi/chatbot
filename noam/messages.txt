I want to set a reminder for 9pm tomorrow to go to the cinema.
Remind me to make an appointment with the hairdresser at noon tomorrow.
Set a reminder for 7 o'clock on the 5th of December to make breakfast for Lisa.
Remind me to take down the trash tomorrow morning.
Give me a notice to create a playlist for Mandy at 4pm.
Remind me to never give up at 6 o'clock tonight.
Yes, I meant that.
Nope.
No way!
Hi there, Noam.
Pleased to meet you, Noam.
Thank you very much.
