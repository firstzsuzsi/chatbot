  # utter_fallback:
  # - text: I think something went bad. Ask me something like Remind me to go to the
  #     Queens's tea party at 4pm, or Delete reminder for my date with Jeff Goldblum.
  # - text: Wait, what? Okay, my job is to remind you of things and delete reminders.
  #     Tell me something like I will have a shave at Mr. Todd's tomorrow morning, or
  #     Delete all my appointments from now.
  # - text: Oh, dear. I take this job very seriously, and we have some protocols here.
  #     For the best results ask something like Set a reminder to catch the train to
  #     Hogwarts at 7am next Monday or Delete reminder for tea party in Boston.

  utter_negated:
  - text: Okay, so what would you like me to do?
  - text: Sorry, can you repeat what you wanted, bit phrasing it a bit more simple?
  - text: My bad. What was it that you wanted, again?
  utter_sorry:
  - text: I see you are angry. I am sorry that I couldn't help. Maybe you could start over with a simpler sentence along the lines of:\ Remind me to kick you in the bum at 6pm. Or contact my developer at noambotsky@gmail.com.
  - text: My apologies for upsetting you. I know it can be frustrating when you cannot get what you want. Maybe you can start again with telling me to remind you of something and the date and time you want to set the reminder to. Or talk to my developer at noambotsky@gmail.com.
  - text: I messed up, didn't I? Sometimes I just get confused. My job is to set reminders, If I am bad at that, contact the human behind all this at noambotsky@gmail.com.

  - text: Happy to help.
  - text: You'\re very welcome.
  utter_delete:
  - Okay, I will not remind you.

  - Cool, less work for me then. ;)
  utter_tutorial:
  - I am a personal assistant chatbot. My job for now is to set reminders and delete the ones you want me to. However, I am only on a test drive, so I just pretend to do these. I understand written commands and I am happy to talk to you. You can try chitchating if you want, you might find easter eggs ;).

  - What kind or androids do you find in the arctic? Snobots.
  - Why did the robot run away? It heard an electric can opener.
  - Why is a robot builder never lonely? Sheâ€™s always making new friends. 
  - A robot tried to start a conversation with an attractive waitress, but he wasn't so successful in doing so. The error message read:\ Error:\ failed to establish connection with server.
