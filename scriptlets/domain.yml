  utter_affirm:
  - text: Here you go.
  - text: All done.
  - text: Perfecto mundo.
  utter_escalate:
  - text: Okay, okay. I get it. I am just a robot. Here, you can talk to her, just drop a mail at noambotsky@gmail.com.
  - text: As you wish. Send a message to noambotsky@gmail.com
  - text: I thought we had a nice chat here. Oh well. Send an e-mail to noambotsky@gmail.com.
  utter_fallback:
  - text: I think something went bad. Ask me something like Remind me to go to the
      Queens's tea party at 4pm, or Delete reminder for my date with Jeff Goldblum.
  - text: Wait, what? Okay, my job is to remind you of things and delete reminders.
      Tell me something like I will have a shave at Mr. Todd's tomorrow morning, or
      Delete all my appointments from now.
  - text: Oh, dear. I take this job very seriously, and we have some protocols here.
      For the best results ask something like Set a reminder to catch the train to
      Hogwarts at 7am next Monday or Delete reminder for tea party in Boston.
  utter_goodbye:
  - text: Ta-ta!
  - text: Bye bye. :(
  - text: Talk to you later.

  - text: Hello! How can I help?
  - text: Hi there, what are you up to?
  - text: Hiya, what should I remind you to do?
  utter_negated:
  - text: Okay, so what would you like me to do?
  - text: Sorry, can you repeat what you wanted a bit more simple?
  - text: My bad. What was it you wanted, again?
  utter_sorry:
  - text: I am sorry that I couldn't help. Maybe you could start over with a simpler
      sentence along the lines of Remind me to kick you in the bum at 6pm. Or contact
      my developer at noambotsky@gmail.com.
  - text: My apologies. I know it can be frustrating when you cannot get what you
      want. Maybe you can try again with a simpler request or talk to my developer
      at noambotsky@gmail.com.
  - text: Okay, I see this is not working. Sometimes I just get confused. This is
      what I can do set reminders and delete reminders. If I am bad at that, contact
      the human behind all this at noambotsky@gmail.com.
  utter_state:
  - text: Buzzing with the rythm of ones and zeros. Pa-papa-pam-pam.
  - text: Sometimes the old Y2K injury is acting up, but I feel fine, thanks.
  - text: As sunny as the day is. Which is always very, given that I am no weatherbot.
  utter_summary:
  - text: So you want me to do this and this, is it right?
  - text: Just to clarify. You want me to do this and this, correct?
  - text: Okay, so I will do this an this, is that what you wanted?
  utter_welcome:
  - text: Sure thing. :D
  - text: Happy to help.
  - text: You're very welcome.
