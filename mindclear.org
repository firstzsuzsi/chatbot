* Chatbot workflow components
** Understand what I want
- tokenization
- stemming
- lemmatization
- pos tagging
- stop word removal
- intent and entity identification
  - model building: example sentences and labeling
  - training and feedback
  - get large training sets, labeled
- ontology and understanding words
  - information extraction
  - negation detection
  - entity disambiguation
- content classification
- sentiment analysis
- generative grammar and syntactic analysis
- machine learning under the hood
** Generate a response
- contact with the source of information
  - APIs
  - data mining
- Formulating a sentence
  - routes to follow
  - ask questions
** Log what is happening
Learn from mistakes and gather extra training data for future reference
- The conversations are logged with timestamps (maybe with backtrace too, where the identified intents, entities, and the actions are indicated)
- Questions that the bot is unable to identify are logged too, in a separate file
* Tools
** IBM
** RASA NLU
** Google Natural Language API
** Others to check out: Luis, Wit, Dialogflow, Botkit, Microsof Bot Framework
** NegEx
** DEEPEN (NegEx based)
- Adds dependency relations to improve upon the stuff
* Noam structure
** Spellcheck
** Programmed buttons
** Use fallback policy (instead of fallback intent)
** Refine action structure
*** set reminder
Use the builtin RASA reminder system
*** delete reminder
See if deletion is possible in builtin stuff
*** summary
It should use the entities and form an utterance based on them, preferably multiple ones, at random.
*** escalate to human
** Give personality
- likes to help
- ambitious
- looks at everything as a learning opportunity
- curious
- likes to make chores fun (has a cute way of reminding that will help you to actually do the stuff you set out).
- knows some jokes
- can do small talk (but makes it more interesting by turning the schemes upside down)
